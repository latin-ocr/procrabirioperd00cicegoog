[Surely this is weaker than the last, and proves either too little or too
much] '

(3) lt is just worth mentioning that while he lays great stress on the
word omnium in pro Rab ἓ 12, and bases arguments thereon, he finds it
convenient to overlook item in Sall Cat 51 ὅ aa, and to force a distinction
or even opposition between the lex Porcia and the alzire leges both there
and in ἓ 40.

(4) He considers it most probable that the valuable exemption
granted by these laws was not extended to all citizens but only to the
cives optimo iure, that is those who had the ius honorum. He argues that
certain cases⁸⁴ of these degrading punishments are known to us, in which
the sufferers were pretty certainly citizens, and in some of them we are
distinctly told so. But they probably had not the ius honorum.

[This is possible, perhaps probable, though not exactly proved. The
cives (cum suffragio) who had not the ius honorum would in any case not
be very numerous. At least I can only discover one class answering to
the description—those3⁵ who, having the Latin right plus the right of
acquiring the Roman full franchise by settlement at Rome, had settled
there, but, not having as yet been enrolled on the list of citizens, were
temporarily regarded as incolae and allowed a sort of limited vote in the
assembly of the tribes]

(5) He urges that the laws have a tribunician air, and that three
members of the Porcian house (whose names he gives) must have been
tribunes in the short space os time mentioned above (a).

[This is the merest conjecture, as he is constrained to admit]

(6) He thinks that a more likely conjecture as to the contents oi the “
three laws is that the first exempted citizens in Rome from the degrading
penalties whether they appealed to the people or not, the second dealt
with citizens abroad‚ and the third was really pro tergo civium as
forbidding scourging altogether.

Α [He admits that one might go on guessing sonte time at this rate.
And surely these would not so readily bear the appearance of one law as
those reconstructed by Lange]

(7) He thinks that the gravis poena mentioned by Livy as contained
in the sanctio os the Porcian law was nothing else than a clause declaring
, that a transgressor was liable to the penalties os perduelttb, in fact that he
was perduellis. ’
