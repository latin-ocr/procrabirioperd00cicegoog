APPENDIX 97

and was employed by Saturninus¹³ against Metellus and by
Clodius against Cicero

· iii. The man was outlawed in the usual form, a lim-it was
named, but the execution of the sentence does not seem to

have been enforced by rewards or penalties as in the above. ,

The outlaw might be put to death by anyone without sear of
punishment. Thus a public penalty was left to be carried
out by the capricious action of private hatred. This wasa
peculiar form of outlawry applied to secondary offenders, the
succourers of those outlawed under (ii). But, while the
harder forms os outlawry were only used in sentences pro·
nounced· by iudicia populi, it seems most probable that this
form was also the ‘capital penalty' of the permanent jury
courts. Instances of this are to be found in the cases of (a)
the risk run¹⁴ by the friends of Cicero in giving him succour
(b) the cases ol the elder Oppianicus and of Verres as simple
criminals.

The consequences of these different degrees of outlawry
would be respectively (i) Death or the imminent risk of it,
(ii) Exile, (iii) A certain amount of risl( of death, to be avoided
by exile, and generally awretched despised outcast existence.

It is interesting in this connexion to consider the expres-
sions employed by Cicero in the perorations os his speeches
on behalf of men accused on capital charges before the jury
courts. We find that in such cases as that of Sextus Roscius
and that of Cluentius he speaks¹³ of the accused as standing
in danger of his life. In such as those of Sulla Sestius
Caelius and Plancius he lays¹⁰ the stress on the banishment
which must follow condemnation. The difference is to be

accounted for by observing that the former were merely cases
os ordinary crime, while the latter were essentially political in
their bearing. It is not however to be inferred that there
was any difference in the penalty: the difference lay in the

¹³ Appian bell civ 1 31. Cluent ἓ roo.
