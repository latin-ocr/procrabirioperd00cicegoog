Roman punishment. The only4‘exception to this was created
by the lex Tullia de ambitu carried by Cicero⁵ in his cousul-
ship: this imposed ten years exile on candidates found guilty
of corrupt practices. But, barring this, it was and long
remained⁶ true that exile was a refuge from punishment and
not a punishment itself. Yet we know that many persons
were driven into exile, though not formally exiled. How
was this? Ι They were ‘interdicted from fire water and
shelter'3 that is to say, outlawed or laid under ban. ,

This proceeding did not deprive' a rnan of his civitas: he
still remained civis, but he lost caput, having in effect lost the
means of enjoying his priVileges as a citizen. Not until he
had actually been made a citizen⁷ of some other community
(residence of course went for nothing) did *he cease to bea
citizen of Rome.

The origin of this penalty is to bc sought in times when
the punishment of death was still in common use. The
accused fled beyond the Roman frontier‚ and in order to bar
his return it became the practice⁸ to lay him formally under

ban. When the punishment of death had ceased to be applied
to political offenders, it was only natural that this penalty
should take its place3 and also that it should become the
severest sentence of the permanent courts For the presence
or absence of the reus made no difference⁹ in the matter or
