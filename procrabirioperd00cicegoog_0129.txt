122 APPENDIX

It will be observed that in the cases of Menenius and
Livius cited above we are told that the victim withdrewindig·
nantly into voluntary exile. The same is reported ¹⁵ of Camil-
lus. And it is surely probable that, as the tribe assembly
cameto be more and more employed as a court of criminal
jurisdiction, means would be found to drive the condemned
into exile. This was most likely at first accomplished by im-
posing a fine of great amount, in the hope that the offender
would be unable¹⁶ either to pay or find sureties (praedes) for
paymcnt of the same, and so become liable to arrest and
imprisonment. To avoid this he would probably fiy from
Roman territory. The practice once begun would then by
these or other means be kept up and become regular through

use. -

Further, 1 would in dealing with this question generally
follow the line of argument taken by a great modern authority¹²
in speaking of the competence of the jury courts and their
relation to the tribe assembly.

Now the decline of the Republic was exactly the period ’
during which the Quaestiones Perpetuae were established, so that
the statutes creating thern were all passed by a legislative assem-
bly which itself could not, at its ordinary sittings, punish a

’ criminal with death. It followed that the Permanent Judicial
Commissions, holding a delegated authority, were circumscribed
, i'n their attributes and capacities by the limits of the powers
” residing with the body which deputed them. They could do
nothing which the Assembly of the Tribes could not have done;
and, as the Assembly could not sentence to death, the Quaestiones

were equally incompetent to award capital punishment.

Though the notion of delegated authority is here perhaps
too definitely and strictly conceived¹⁸ to be quite accurate, it
