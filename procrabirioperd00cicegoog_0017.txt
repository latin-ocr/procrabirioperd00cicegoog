(ν) Dionysius vm 80 (some wanted to put Sp Cassius'
children to death, but the senate interposed: hence the still
preserved custom) ἀφεῖσθαι τιμωρίας ἁπάσης τοὺς παῖδας ὦν
ἂν οἱ πατέρες ἀδικήσωσιν, ε’άν τε τυράννων ὄντες υἱοὶ τύχωσιν, ’
’ἐάν τε πατροκτόνων, ἐάν τε προδοτῶν, ὃ μέγιστόν ἐστι παρ’
ἐκείνοις ἀδίκημαῗ.

(α) The word perdrullis originally meant ‘enemy'. This
is proved, not only by its derivation from duellum and the
prefix per which stamped it with an unfavourable¹ sense found
also in perfidus periurus perdere perire perperam etc, but
also by the testimony of antiquity⁹ and the many surviving
traces³ of ancient usage. But as the word lrestr‘s lost its
original wide meaning ‘stranger’ and cameto mean no more
than ‘enemy'3 so by a like narrowing perduellis came to mean
only ‘internal enemy', a traitor or enemy to his own country.
The offence committed by such a person is perduellio, a term
vclosely corresponding to our ‘high treason ³.
