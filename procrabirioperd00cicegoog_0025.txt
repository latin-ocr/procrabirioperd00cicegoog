himself. The day was already fixed by the consul or (accord

accuser had in the first instance to ask for the appointment of
a day for holding a meeting of the comitia centuriata, to give
the final decision. And a certain interval¹⁷ had to be left
between this day of formal assembly and the end of the in-
formal procedure in contiones. Another difference was that
from this time forth the people had before them the definite
issue²⁸ upon which they would be required to pass judgment.
At the end of the third hearing the accuser was in a position
to judge of the feeling of the people‚ and so to draw up his
indictment as to have the best chance of procuring the con-
demnation of the accused. This he did, and posted it up
in the forum for all to see during a space of three market

ι days (trinum nundinum), the statutable interval which had to

elapse before the formal comitia could be held for the final
decision.

merely parts of the one enquiry (anquiritur) which termi-
