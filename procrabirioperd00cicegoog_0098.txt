'permanent‘ tribunal.. Thus peculatus was in some way defined,
and brought under the cognizance of a quaestio perpetua¹¹.
' The precise date of this step Ι am unable to determine. The
passage in the rheortical treatise addressed to Herennius
seems certainly to refer to a time when the offence had been
defined, and we may probably assume that the quaestio per·
petua peculatus was already in full course of work. The
treatise is assigned¹² to the year 84 BC or later. This inclines
meto think that the court was already established before
the dictatorship of Sulla, and not in the first instance bya
lex Cornelia of that legislator. Indeed the existence of a lex
Cornelia depeculata is nowhere (so far as l can discover)
directly attested, and Lange¹³‚ who hesitatingly assumes it,
seems to make out but a weak case. The a priori likelihood
of such an enactment proceeding from Sulla Ι do not deny.
All I can admit for certain. is that the ¹standing court was in
existence before BC 70, the year of the trial of Verres

(3) As to the penalties inflicted on the guilty in earlier
times we, have no satisfactory information. Probably they
varied according to the degrees of guilt in the accused and
punishment called for by the accuser. Restitution would no
doubt be enforced by a money fine3 whether of greater
amount than the peculation5‚ is not certain. This would
probably be accompanied¹⁴ by iufamia, and (in very bad cases
at least) by aquae et egaea interdictio and confiscation of the
offender’sproperty. Of the effects of conviction under the
quaestio perpetua we have fuller knowledge. The condemned
