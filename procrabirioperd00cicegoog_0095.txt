Cicero, they saw the senate still in possession and use of this
power aster the death os Caesar.

Republican Rome—the great practical. control of the ma-

against any decided movemont of the comitia of the tribes.
Thus the degradation of the Legislature and Judicature was
accompanied or even preceded by. a wretched weakenIng of
the Executive.
