12 INTRODUCTION

became impossible to refuse this, and so the patricians lost
their chief motive for resisting the extension of the tribunician
powers in‘ this direction. Hence it is that, when once the
legislative power of the tribes becomes coordinate with that
of the centuries‚ we find the tribunes acting as accusers in
capital trials before the latter body⁹ without any opposition
from the patricians. No doubt these last reflected that it was
better to be brought before the centuries than the tribes, it
being so much more difficult to secure a condemnation.

(c) We now pass on to consider the division os a criminal
trial before the people (iudicium populi) into the proceeding
in iure and that in iudicio. The view of Zumpt¹⁰ is that the
in iure division is found under three forms for different pur·
poses or at different dates. There are (1) the sctum of the
early Republic, doubtless not granted without careful inquiry,
(2) the preliminary proceeding before the magistrate in cases
of ‘ordinary' or non-political trials‚ (3) the proceeding before
the magistrate and the hearings before the people down to y
the end os the third hearing, the procedure employed in the
‘extraordinary’ trials‚ those of political import. It is with
the details of these ‘extraordinary’ trials that we are con-
cerned here. Now the view of Zumpt is open to this objec-
tion. The three hearings referred to were conducted before
the whole body of citizens assembled in contio, and these
citizens are also the ultimate judges in the case: besides
witnesses are produced on all three occasions. This is very
unlike what we know of other proceedings in iure, and it is
perhaps safer in the grievous dearth of evidence to hold that

the first appearance of the accused before the accusing magis-
trate is the true in iure proceeding in such cases. Then the

first three hearings will count as parts of the proceeding in
