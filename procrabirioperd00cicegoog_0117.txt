This lex Sempronia seems to belong to the first tribunate
ofC Gracchus, 123 BC. His object in bringing forward such
a proposal was twofold. First, he had to revenge the death⁸
of his brother and the banishment⁷ of a number of his ad-
herents The person principally aimed at was P Popillius
Laenas, who had been president of the quaestio extraordinaria
by which the followers of Ti Gracchus had been tried. ln
the second place he had to win the favour of the people by
popular measures3 and this law, prohibiting these trials by
special commissions except with the consent of the people,
was aimed directly at the assumption of such powers by the
senate. .

That the appointment of such special commissions by the
. senate without the sanction of a popular vote was strictly
speaking an unconstitutional step, cannot be doubted. But
in this matter as in others by the gradual disuse⁸ of what was
a necessary condition of validity the senate had come to con·
sider itself entitled to act alone: if any demagogue attacked
them on this ground it was generally⁹ possible to employ in
their defence the intercession of one tribune against another.
After the overthrow of the elder Gracchus the nobles pro-

ceeded in this unconstitutional manner against the remaining
leaders of the popular party: and again in the case of the
Catilinarian conspirators the senate formed itself into a sort
of High Commission to try them. Even Cicero could only
defend this conduct on the ground that men who had been
declared public enemies could not claim the right to be treated
as citizens.
