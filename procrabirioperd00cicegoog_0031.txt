most—public offenders, and was recommended by the greater -
ease with which a conviction could be obtained. The pro-
cedure was the same as that described above, so tfar as the
three hearings and following interval were concerned: but
the fourth hearing took the simple form of a motion in the
comitio tributo for the infliction of a fine on the accused. It
was a rogatio of the ordinary legislative kind: the accuser
was said irrogare multam.

(u) In connexion with these two forms of trial it will
be well to speak⁸⁹ of the word iudicare, which in some passages
seems to bear a remarkable sense. The passages are quoted
at the head of the Introduction, so that they need only be
referred to here. First come Cicero’s words in de domo ξ 45
ulter onte ...... quone multam irroget aut iudicet. The two
expressions are clearly coordinate, and the former means
‘moving for the infliction of a fine' (before the tribes) : surely
then iudicet refers to the process before the centuries: but what
is the iudicium implied? ln de legibus III § 6 we have ruzrltoe
corresponding to irrogassit and poenae to iudicassit. [If the
expressions in pro Milone ᾖ 36 be really altemativeS, this
passage would be very important here, but see note on pas·
sage (o) at head]. In Livy I 26 §7 we find tibi perduellionem
indico, in XLIII 16 ξ 11 utrique censori perduellionem se iu-
dicare. But in Livy XXVI 3 ἓξ 8,9 we have oel capitis vel
pecuniae iudicasset and perduellionis se indicare Cn Fulrn'o.
Here we have iudicare used in speaking of the fine and the
capital penalty alike. Nor is this unnatural‚ if we regard all
the jurisdiction of the comitio as based on the right of appeal,
and the appeal as necessarily preceded by a iudicium of some
kind, from which the appeal is made. This view is borne out
by Cicero de legibus 111§ 10 where the power of iudicium is
