duty (in the early times when we hear of it) had probably

nothing official¹⁰ about it, it is to be noted that the passages ’

upon which this view rests are chiefly such as are referred to
above on (3), which give no such inference when fairly re-.r
garded, or such as Tac ann XI 22, which only speaks in
general terms¹¹ of the recovery by the equites of a share in the
iudicia. It may also be asked how it comes that, if there was
an office of this name important enough to be held by equites,
we still have no reference to any function as falling within its
competence.

(9) As to the date at which the tribuni aerarii became
recognized as an erd0¹², we have no materials that enable us
to determine it even approximat ly. The reference in pro ἱ
Rabirio ξ 27 has been explained by Madvig to mean that
men who in 63 BC were equites and tribuni aerarii had as
young men in 100 BC taken part in the suppression of Satur-
ninus. But this interpretation, which seems to me a very
forced one, has been rejected by Mommsen and Becker. I
venture to think that the members of those ordines at the time
are meant, even as the senatus and *tzobitttas of ἓξ 20, 21¹ are
the senators etc of that time. If this be s0‚ it will follow that
(a) the tribuni aerarii were already an ordo in 100 BC, and
consequently (b) were not first recognized as such by the lex
Aurelia of 70 BC.
