centuriata. This was to indicate that watch and ward was
being duly kept at that post by a guard set there for that
purpose For inasmuch as the centuries met outside the city
wall, and represented the armed force* of the Roman people,
it was dangerous to leave the city in their rear exposed to the
ι attack ol an enemy, whose first step would be to occupy the
Janiculum. No further business could be transacted⁸ at the
meeting when the hauling down os the ensign announced the
withdrawal of the guard. He adds that the custom was still
kept up in his time from religious motives.

Macrobius sat1 16 ξ 15 speaks os treginta dies⁴ quibus
exercitui imperato vexillum russi coloris in arce positum est.
Livy XXXIX 15 ξ 11 says cum vexillo in arce posito comitiorum
causa exercitus eductus esset.

There is here an apparent disagreement as to the spot
where the guard and flag were planted, sor at Rome arx
usually denoted the citadel on the Capitoline: and from the
place os assembly in the Campus Martius both the Capitoline
and the Janiculum would be visible. But there can Ι think

be little doubt that Weissenborn is right⁶ in taking arx to
stand for the Janiculum in this connexion. That this was
traditionallya menaced point os strategic importance is clear

from the story os Cocles in Livy Π 10 ἓξ 3, 4. And the word
arx is used ol it (though quite untechnically)in1 33 ξ 6.
Lange however (Rom Alt 1 55 5) seems to incline to the view
that the arx in question was that commonly so called on the
Capitoline.
