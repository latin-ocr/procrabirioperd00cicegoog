majority of centuries pronounced the accused guilty of
the charge preferred against him, the president declared
the result and handed over the prisonerl⁴ to the accuser for

was apso facto a free man in possession of all his former rights.

As the vote was in effect a simple Aye or No, there could be
no other sentence passed on him than that proposed by the
accuser.

dure though clumsy to the last degree had at all events done
its work. But there could be no security for this, and indeed
the wonder is that it ever worked at all-at least so as to
