(3) Thus at last the Roman in any part of the world
where Roman law was respected could guard himself
from cruel scourging by the plea civis Romanus sum.
But the wanton and needless distinction thus made
between the Roman and the ‘Latin only served to
impress more vividly on the latter the already present
sense oi his own inferior position, which the loyal
service rendered in the second Punic war entitled him
to regard as undeserved. This rankled in the minds of
the Latin communities and bore bitter fruit ior Rome
at a later day.

I have now to speak oi the view os Zumpt³²‚ which is in many im·

l will take the chief os these points of difference one by one

(ι) He argues that Cato cannot have been the author of the first law,
or we should have found mention os it in Plutarch's account of his life. The
quotation from Festus (see above) merely proves that Cato spoke on the
subject: but sohedid on other laws ; and Livy, whoireely used his speeches‚
must have made mention of this, or at least of the law, by name. Least
of all can it be placed in the year oi Cato's praetorship, for he was governor
ol Sardinia& and had his hands rull.

[l can only say that these moderate probabilities do not prove the
negative of the moderately probable view of Lange]

(2) He holds that the first law cannot have been passed earlier than
166 Be, nor the third later than 134 Bo For Livy's history (which must
have given an account oi this legislation) is in our hands down to¹ 167, and
does not tell us oi their enactment: and the procedure of Scipio at
Numantia was clearly a novel one. If it were not, why should Livy
lay such stress on it as to make his abridger put the affair into his
epitome? And, if novel, it must have been in consequence of some new
legislation, recent or impending. lt must have been recent, or we should
hear of it in Livy's account of the campaigns of Aemilius Paullus. BesideS,
ir the three laws were passed in a space os about thirty yearS, it is easier
to understand their being generally regarded as one.
