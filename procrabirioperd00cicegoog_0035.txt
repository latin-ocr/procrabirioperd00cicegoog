that in its conception of the crime in question it trenched

on those of reperandae and peculatus.
(q) Nor is it hard to see how it affected that of the old

crime of perduellio. The two terms were now practically
coextensive‚ and the real difference lay in procedure only.
But this difference was all in favour of maiestas, which accord·

ingly superseded perduellio. The jury court took the place of
the clumsy comittit, a iudicium publicum of a iudicium populi.
What had never been a truly technical expression gave way .
to one which was gradually defined and specialized. Thus
ade facto revolution in criminal jurisprudence that had long
been in progress was quietly accomplished. The old law or
laws of perduellio were not abolished‚ and it was no doubt in
theory still possible to punish under this name any of the
multifarious offences to which it had once regularly been
applied. But in practice this was not done, and the rarity of
those offences (if any) that could only be treated as perduellio
and not as maiestas· caused the older term and forms of
procedure to fall into disuse. It was therefore an unfair
proceeding to bring Rabirius to trial at all on a charge of
perduellio3 and still more unfair to rake up the antiquated
statute that governed the trial by duumvirs Rabirius might

tried on a charge of imminuta maiestas, or of ou under the
