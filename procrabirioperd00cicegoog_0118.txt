Cicero tells us (pro Rab§ 12) thatC Gracchus carried a
law ne de capite civium Romanorum iniussu vestro [sc populi]
iudoareturw. This is the most explicit statement on the sub·
ject that has come down to us from any Latin author: and it
must therefore serve as our chief text in the following enquiry
concerning the contents of the law.

(ι) It seems to have reenacted (a) the provisions of the
Valerian laws²l on provocatio, as may be gathered frorn -
Cicero’s appeal to the Sempronian together with the Porcian
laws as having been violated by Verres in the case of Gavius,
and (b) provisions resembling those of the Porcian¹’ laWS, by
a general prohibition of the penalty of death, as is to be
gathered from the passages¹⁸ of Cicero and Sallust relating to
the Catilinarian affair.

(2) lt expressly forbade the trial and sentencing of citi-
zens so as to affect their caput, the rights and privileges of a
free Roman citizen, by a quaestio extraordinaria without the
consent of the people.

(3) The difficulty now meets us in the attempt to dis-
cover what there was new in all this. Surely there must
have been some new provision in the law. Yet it does seem,
as Zumpt asserts, that all these enactments were, sofar as
relates to the liability of offending magistrates already in
existencc; and it can hardly be supposed that in such a
period as that of the Gracchi they were in serious danger
of being forgotten. Zumpt then argues that the novelty must
have consisted in the extension of the liability to those who
took part in this violation of citizen right, such as the board
of advisers (consilz'um)¹⁴ by whom the offending magistrate
