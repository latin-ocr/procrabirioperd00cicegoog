INTRODUCTION

6. ln§ 1 we find defensio capitis famae fortunarumque
omnium, in ξ 3 supplicium, in ξ 5 dimicatio capitis famae
fortunarumque omizium, and have mention of Rabirius'
salus to be preserved, and of his vita being staked on
the popular vote. [ἐξ 10-17 do not concern us here, and
have been dealt with above} ln§§ 3, 31 we hear of suppli-
cium, in ξ 31 capitis citantur. But in the peroration ξ 36
we leam that Rabirius fears famae vulnus and impetus
civium. In ξ 37 we have clear reference to exile, which
would deprive him of honourable death and burial at
home. Now we know what extravagant language
Cicero could employ when it suited him, and I do not
think that there is anything in. all this to shew that
the life of Rabirius was really in danger⁰¹ from the result
of the trial at which this speech was delivered. The
peroration seems even in its fragmentary state to contain
evidence⁸² to the contrary effect. And Cicero is appeal-
ing for an old man (ἓ 2) who could not in the course of
nature (ξ 37) live many more years. The real question
is, what connexion can there be between multae irro-
gatio on the one hand and exile and infamio on the
other? This Ι have considered in an appendix (K),
and arrived at the conclusion that there was such a
connexion in some cases at least. Holding this view,
l cannot but regard the expressions in the peroration
as sufficient to prove that the stronger ones which come
earlier in the speech are intentionally overdrawn. Ι

’ cannot believe that the references to loss of caput prove
the speech to have been delivered before the centuries,
or that the risk to Rabirius’ vita means any more than
the possibility of a disastrous change in the conditions

os his life.
