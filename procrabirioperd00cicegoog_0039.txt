making of a disadvantageous treaty. Secretvoting was intro-
duced sor the purpose os securing his condemnation; a step
which probably brought 2'udz'cia populi into greater disrepute
than ever. See Cic de legibus 111 §36‚ Zumpt 1 2 pp 348-9,

The above cases are all before the lex Appuleia de maiestate.
The following is especially interesting, coming as it does after
the three laws on that subject, os which we spoke above.

(12) C Verres was prosecuted in a jury court on a charge
oi repetundae in 70 BC. In the accusatio composed by Cicero
occurs the following remarkable passage (11 in Verrem Ι §§ 8—
14). Cicero describes what he would have done had Verres
been acquitted in the court os repetundae. He says that if he
escape this, he will accuse him of peculatus (ξ 11); if he escape
again, he will accuse him os maiestas (ξ 12); if the jury in this
court also aequit him, he will bring him to the bar of the
Roman people itsels, from whose just indignation he will not
escape. Though the word perduellio is not used, there can be
no other interpretation of the threat. Verres' gross abuse os
his official powers his scourging and putting to death Roman
citizens iniussu populi would easily have sufficed to establish
such a charge. The orator recurs to it again v ἓξ 173, 178,
183.
