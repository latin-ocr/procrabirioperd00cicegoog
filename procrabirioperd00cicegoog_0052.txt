The'defence is resumed in the form
of a narrative in which stress is laid
upon all the points in which any justifi-
cation can be found for· the conduct of
Rabirius on the occasion in question.
He only did what all the best men in
Rome did. He acted as a true patriot
and accepted a responsibiiity which it
would have been cowardly to shirk. The
decisions os the law courts shew the
opinion of recognized public authorities
on the cause of Saturninus, To condemn
Rabirius now is to stain with ignominy
the names of all 'the men os whom Rome
was then proud—even that os her great
hero Marius That Marius is dead, is
no answer to this: we should reverence
the dead, and honour as we would be
honoured. BesideS, we know that the
real slayer of Saturninus has been al-
ready publicly recognized and rewarded.
