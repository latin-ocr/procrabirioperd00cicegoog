(8) Isidorus V 26 peculatus iudicium iu cas datur qui frau-
dein aeraria faciunt pecuniamque publicam intervertunt. iiam
a pecunia peculatus est dictus. teau autem sic iudicatur furtum
publicae rei sicut eei privatae: ream illc sic iudicatur ut sacrilc- <
gres, quia fur est sacrarum'.

From our evidence we may draw the following inferences

' (1) The term peculatus had its origin in denoting the
thest of the beasts paid as fines to the state3 but the employ-
ment of eoined money and the development of a more com·
plex civilization caused an extension of its meaning so as to
include the theft of any kind of state property. As instances
of peculatus in this wider sense we can point to cases8 of mis-
appropriation of the booty or war-indemnity by victorious
generals, embezzlement of publio moneys by state officers to
whom they had been entrusted for public purposes, of corn
and money by 'provincial governors, of sacred objects statues
etc by the same, fraud on the part of a state eontrac-
tor⁹, etc.

(2) The offence was no doubt originally dealt with by a
iruliciuiu papuli, the clumsy appliance of a community still in
an early stage of growth. Men’s conception of wrong done to
the state being very hazy, they carry out the trial and punish-

ment of individual offenders by separate legislative acts¹⁰ as ’

occasions successively require. As a rough definition of this
or that class of offence is worked out in practice, and the
inconvenience of the old procedure is more strongly felt, it
