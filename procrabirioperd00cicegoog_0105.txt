classes os men against whom the different charges would
commonly be brought. The latter kind would generally
affect only men of wealth and position, who would be able to ,
avail themselves of the protection afforded by exile against
the hardships to which meaner criminals were forced to
submit¹⁷.

Two changes in respectos the mildest formos this penalty,
that inflicted by the permanent courts or in the provinces by
the govemors’ courts, took place before the establishment ol
the empire. First‚ an edict ol the tribunes ol BC 72 ordained¹⁸
that no one who had been found guilty ol a capital offence
should remain in Rome. Second, it seems that Caesar when
dictator added¹⁹ a money fine, which in the case ol parricides
extended to confiscation of a man's whole property.

This last was indeed a very important change. For so
long as the outlaw could go abroad, taking his money with
him, the intention ol such sentences was ever being flagrantly
evaded. Some pleasant provincial town, glad to engage in
its interest one who most likely had still many powerful
friends at Rome, afforded him a eomlortable asylum where he
would leel no deprivation save of the political intrigues os the
capital. But when a poor man had been thus outlawed,
his condition²⁰ was pitiable in the extreme. Driven from
Rome, excluded lrom the municipal townS, exposed without
protection to all manner os hardship and wrong, his life
depending on the forbearance of his enemies, his scanty
property at the mercy of his neighbours’ cupidity or spite,-
life must to such have been hardly worth the keeping. All
this the wealthy man was able to avoid by residence abroad;
all this he incurred if while outlawed he ventured to return.
