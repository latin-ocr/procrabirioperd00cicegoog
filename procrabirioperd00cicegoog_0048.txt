that the matter of ξς 11-16 must have filled a far more
considerable place in the speech before the centuries
Surely there would have been no less said about the
cruelty of Labienus’ proposals probably far more about
the obsoleteness of the ancient procedure, and the
irregular nomination of the duumvirs'¹ must have been
one of the main points of attack. But this last is in
our speech only casually referred to in ξ 12.

4 Whether the contio mentioned in ξ 2 5 be one in
which Cicero, is at the time²⁶ speaking, Ι cannot say.
Huschke²' is confident that it is. l am inclined to think
that it refers t0 one of the earlier hearings of what I
believe to have been a fine-process. The words quam
tu habes would prove Huschke’s viewpright were there ¹
not quod ¹habuit domi suae in the preceding section.

5. The half-hour limit (ἐξ 6, 9), assigned by Labi·
enus²⁸ to the speech of Cicer0, suits better with proce-
dure before the' tribes (where the tribune could preside)
than with that before the centuries. Or it may be
an indication that the speech was delivered before a
contio at one of the three preliminary hearings of a
popular trial. If so, and the passage ξ 17 liberum tem·
pus dabitur etc be rightly referred to a forecast of
the fuller speech on the occasion of the fourth hearing,
then the supposition⁹⁹ that this speech falls in one of the
contiones of the fine-process gains great probability. But
Ι am in doubt on this point. The llmitation was pro· ¹

⁴ bably in any case an arbitrary act, but it was clearly
based on the tribune's power of intercessio ,· and this we
know could be exercised³⁰ in any assembly.

ω Quintilian (quoted in my note) remembered that in this case the tri·
seems to think that it is. hune would preside. See on 5 6 com-
