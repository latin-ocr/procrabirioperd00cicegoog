INTRODUCTION l l

iudicium or trial proper a magistrate cum imperio had to pre-
side: hence such were excluded from appearing as accusers.
It should be observed that the popular jurisdiction as we find
it under the Republic was no doubt developed³ out of the
provocatio or right of appeal against the exercise of the magis-
trate's imperium or coercitio. Indeed the iudicio populi in
cases of no political bearing⁴-what Zumpt calls the ‘ordi-
nary' procedure-always rested directly on this right of the
citizen to appeal. The appeal lay to the people in their cen-
turies. We shall see that in trials of political import (such as
perduellio) the connexion with the right of appeal was less⁵
direct. With the later action of the comitia tributa and
their competence to pass sentence in certain cases we have
for the present nothing to do. But it is well to take notice of
their action⁰ in the period before theTwelve Tables, because
it was out of the struggles connected therewith that the later
power of the tribunes as accusers was developed. It was
constantly maintained by the patricians that the plebs and its
magistrates⁷ had uo jurisdiction over patricians. But they
were not able to make their contention good except so far as
to require that before a tribune brought a patrician to the bar
of the assembled plebs he must have obtained permission from
the senate in the form of a sctum⁸ to that effect. Gradually it
