(b) It is impossible to give any more precise definition of
perduellio by specifying any class or classes of actions to
which alone that term could strictly speaking be applied. 1
cannot find that the ancients themselves had any such defini-
ti0n; nor is such to be looked for⁴ in the infancy of juris·
prudence. At the same time it is to be observed that the

word needed no further definition. We hear of a law of '

perduellio existing in the regal period; but it seems to have
dealt only with the procedure to be followed and the punish·
ment to be inflicted on the guilty. The truth is that in a
trial for perduellio the question raised was not so mucha
question of fact as of intent or effect. If the people hold that
a citizen has by some course of action harmed or imperilled
the state, they find him guilty of perduellzo: if not, they
aequit him. Thus, by being the ultimate judge of the quality⁸

of the action, the sovereign people is the guardian of its own
safety and honour.

It is only by holding fast this conception of perduellio that
we can¹ understand how it was that such a variety of offences
were able to be brought under it. We hear of many forms of
treason directly political, both within the city, as attempts to
kill injure or impede in execution os duty the officers of the
state, misuse of magisterial powers, aiming at monarchy⁰,
and indeed conspiracies in genera13 also without the city, as
treasonable assistance of or correspondence with an enemy:
and of others not directly political but either military, as
cases of cowardice neglect or other misconduct in the field;
or religiouS, as neglectos auspices etc; or such injuries as are
inflicted upon the state by violence used by a fraudulent con-
tractor to defeat the ends of justice: a strange though not
exhaustive list of offences, which had only this one point⁷ in
common, that they were held to outrage the majesty and
endanger the security of Rome.
