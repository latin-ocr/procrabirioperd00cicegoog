tioned as well as that with which it stands in more
immediate connexion. This will hold whether we read
perscriptum or praescriptum, though 1 prefer the former.
It·is a very forced interpretation²¹ to refer the multae
irrogatio to some other case—eg that of C Curtius (ξ ),
which was almost certainly tried before the jury court
os peculatus. If my view of this passage be correct.
this evidence is of itself almost enough to establish
my vrew.

2. The references in ἓξ 10,17, to Cicero's previous
action, so bitterly complained of by Labienus, are if
taken naturally¹² rather to be referred to the consul’s
whole opposition to the trial than to the mere lighten-
ing of the penalty²⁸ of perduellio which Cicero and his
party had probably succeeded in effecting. The reason
why Cicero so thrusts the penalty question to the front
is manifest The whole case was essentially political,
and the most powerful feeling upon which it was now
possible for the orator to work was undoubtedly the
Roman citizen's pride in his exemption²⁴ from horrible
and degrading punishment. Hence he brings in the
subject of the perduellio trial in such a way as to justify
a digression on the terrors of the scourge and the cross,
which, in defiance of the laws meant to guard the person
of a Roman, atribune would have brought back again
but for the humanity of a consul. [Huschkep 517 calls
attention to the use of the perfect in ξ 17 esse depulsum,
neglexisti, §28 putavit, though in more vivid passages
presents are used, as ἐξ 11-13. Perhaps conatus es op-
posed to facis in ξ 13 is the most striking instance.
But I do not lay much stress on this point. Perhaps

ξ 16 auribus and mentio refer to what Labienus had
before proposed]
