IN publishing an edition of a speech ol Cicero where the
text bears so small a proportion to the whole work as is here
the case, Ι feel bound to explain my reasons sor producing
it in such a state.

I was driven to choose between two courseS, either to
issue merely a text with explanatory notes, or to attempt
to grapple with all the many difficulties that environ the

subject. The former os these would be useless, and no .

middle course seemed profitable. 1 have therefore made
the ambitious attempt to find some sound solution ol all
the difficulties: but 1 am well aware that in so doing I
have undertaken an enterprise beyond my powers,

The speech is unique, and involves constitutional and
legal questions ol the first importance to students of Roman
history, which have for the most part to be answered by
painful examination ol meagre and sometimes conflicting
evidence. In the collection of this, and in the consultation
of the lengthy and often ill-arranged treatises of modern
writers on the subject, Ι have found the volume of matter ⁴
increase upon me daily: and have at last been compelled
to leave off with the knowledge that some parts of my work
are in a painfully crude state. And this probably applies
lar more widely than 1 am aware.
