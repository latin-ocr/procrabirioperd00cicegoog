APPENDIX 87

acomplete justification of all acts of violence perpetrated in
the interests of order. To reward the slayer of such a public
enemy was only a logical consequence of such a declaration.

(6) The most important point in this enquiry is the
question of legality. Was this action of the senate con-
stitutional, or was it not? A statement of the evidence under
various heads will fumish the answer.

(a) There was no lexin grant or* confirmation of
the right in question. ’ ’

(b) When we find any reference to its basis, it is in
effect made to rest on use and custom only. The very
anxiety of Cicer0¹l to give it the appearance of im-
memorial antiquity arises from a consciousness of the
lack of other authority.

(c) We know that Cicero was himself called to
account for his action against the associates of Catiline,
which was taken under the supposed protection¹² of
the sctum ultimum. The prosecution of Rabirius was·
a challenge to the senate on the same ground.

It is thus pretty clear that the action of the senate was
not¹³ in a strict sense legal. But that it had not become
constitutional by use can hardly be maintained in the
face of the words of Sallust and Caesar quoted above. At
what date the procedure was first employed, we do not know,
nor is it material to enquire: its real constitutional importance
dates (as Ι have shewn above) from the third century BC. As
in the practice of granting special dispensations¹⁴ from the
operation of certain statutes, no doubt the senate assumed
the right at a favourable moment, and then in the gradual
