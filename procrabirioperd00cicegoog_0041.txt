(α) C Rabirius an aged senator was brought to triall early
in BC 63 ior the murder ol Saturninus. Thirty six suli years
had gone by since that turbulent demagogue had been cut off
by authority oi the senate. Rabirius had confessedly taken
part in the suppression oi the rising oi Saturninus, and had
according to one account afterwards shewn a needless and
brutal² exultation at the tribune's sall. But it does not seem
to have been proved or evenyprobable'that it was he who
struck⁸ the fatal blow. Indeed a slave had been‘ publicly
recognised as the slayer oi Saturninus and duly rewarded
sor the deed. But ¹that on which Rabirius and others who
took the same side relied lor their security was certainly the

sctum ultimum to those who acted under cover ol that
decrec.
