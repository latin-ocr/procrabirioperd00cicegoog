INTRODUCTION

though forbidden by usage [moribus] Still it remains
true that he makes no mention of a nerrltae irrogatio.

Dion wrote in the latter partot of the second centuryAD
or the earlier partt of the third.

2. Suet tonius, when he says that the spite of Caesar
served Rabirius better than anything else in his appeal
to the people, is also thinking ofuthe trial lor perduellio.
But his words surely imply either that the people ac-
quitted Rabirius or that they were inclined to do s0.
Now Dion says the very contrary-that he would have
been convicted before the people also. There is there-

political bearing of the trial is clear in both accounts,
but the details are slurred over by Suetonius, who only

second century A D.

3. Cicero writing to Atticus in 60 BC gives a list

of 12 speeches which he was editing. They were to be
a collection of consular speeches of political rather than
forensic interest. Of these the fourth¹' is for Rabirius.
But whether the surviving speech rs that referred to

apply very well to the present speech. But the words
perduellionis reo do not prove that the speech-even
granting that it is referred to—is the one delivered
before the assembly of centuries on the appeal from
