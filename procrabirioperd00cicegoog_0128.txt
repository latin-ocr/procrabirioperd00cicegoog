the disgrace of a similar condemnation, which 'he lived to
avenge. So L Iunius¹⁰ the colleague os P Claudius Pulcher
Α died by his own hand to avoid thedisgrace os a condemnatiom
In all these cases the word used by the Latin writers is agno-
minia in its general sense. There is no infamia, nothing with
which legal consequences are bound up. But it seems clear
that when a fine-process was regarded as of an essentially
criminal nature the matter would probably be taken up by the
next censors¹¹and a real technical ignominia imposed on the
offender. Gradually popular sentiment¹² came to regard these
criminal fine-processes as necessarily bringing disgrace on the
condemned. At last wc fi‘nd a step taken towards the direct
recognition of this. In ton Bc was passed the lex Cassia ol
the tribune L Cassius Longinus of which Asconius ¹³ says quaa
populi iudicia firmavit. He adds that Cassius carried a num-
’ ber os laws to weaken the power ol the nobles, in quibusdam
ctiam ut, quempopulus damnasset cuive imperium abrogasset¹⁴‚
in senatu non esset. The law wasaimed chielly⁸ at Q Servilius
[Caepio] consul two years before, who had been deprived os
his command by the people because of his deieatby the
cimbri. It manifestly imposed a certain degree of infamia.
We shall now I think be justified in declaring it probable that
¹in the later times os the Republic men fined by sentence
oi the tribes-at least lor heinous offences—lost somewhat

of their repute and standing as citizens and. became so sar
infames.
