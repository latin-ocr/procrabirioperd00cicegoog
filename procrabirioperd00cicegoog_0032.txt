INTRODUCTION 21

assigned to all magistrates, while in ξ 27 this power is ex-
plained to be the basis of provocatio. Indeed this right of
appeal must necessarily have tested on something that was
technically and historicallya iudicium, however insignificant
and formal it might be And the more firmly provocatio was
established, the more formal the iade'eiam became. Not only
would the ierdr'eiam of an accuser be necessarily a condemna-
tion, but without condemnation there would be no appeal.
Hence Cicero (pro Rab§ 12) complains that the sentence of
the duumvirs was practically no iudicium at all. [And it
seems that the later Romans were led, by their regarding it
as a mere formality themselves, to fancy that in the regal
period acquittal by the duumvirs was even barred by statute,
see note on passage (δ) at head]. Hence it will be seen that '
even in a fine-process there is technicallya iudicium to begin
with, though practically of no effect in itself, but only ren-
dered effectual by a final⁴⁰ confirmatory vote of the tribes
given on the question raised by the appeal. That we do not
find the expression poenam capitalem irrogare in use is to be
explained by the phrases employed in the first stage of
capital and fine processes respectively—perduellioreem tibi
r’adr’co, multare tibi elica—where it is seen at once that iade'eare
was most strictly used in referring to the capital process
before the centuries. That it could well be used in referring
to the fine process before the tribes I have shewn above: the
newer word irrogare seems to have been regularly confined
to the second stage of the process before the tribes.

(o) I feel bound also to add that Zumpt strongly holds⁴¹
the opinion that since the Twelve Tables perduellio bore the

general sense of an offence⁴² worthy of death. This view,
which was also that of Sigonius, he supports by a number of
arguments of which the following are the most important.
We see that in the cases of P Claudius Pulcher and Cn
Fulvius the perduellio is of a very general nature ; indeed in

Quinctius Dionysius x 5 says εἰσάγουσιν in a fine-process.
