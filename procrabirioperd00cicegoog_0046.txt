the duumvirs They contain a rhetorical description os
Cicero’s whole action in the matter. The title os the
speech itsell may have come down from Cicero himself.
Even then it may as Huschke²⁸ says have been given
with an eye rather to the striking feature of the whole
case than to the new phase upon which the case had
(it is thought) now entered. But it is more likely that
it was given by a copyist, chiefly with intent to dis—
tinguish it from the speech pro C Rabirio Postumo.

volved in the case of Rabirius was whether the honour
and greatness (maiestas) os Rome should be maintained
(‘asserted' or ‘vindicated'l or not: hence he gave the
rein to his power of exaggeration. This also would
apply to the present speech. But it speaks only os
the caseos Rabirius generally, and it tells us nothing
as to when or where this or any other speech was
delivered.

It will be seen that the external evidence ison the face os
it either neutral or unfavourable to the view in which I have
declared my concurrence. But it will also be seen that it is
not of such a‘ nature as to overpower good internal evidence
opposed to it, is such be forthcoming. And it will I think be
admitted that Cicero’s own references to his defence os Rabi-
rius are not such as he would have made to a pleading in
which he had been unsuccesssul, as he seems to have been in
speaking before the centuries.
