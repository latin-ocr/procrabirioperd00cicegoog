Introd C (i).

(3) Into the details of the famous case of M Manlius
(384130) it is unnecessary to go. The account in Livy is
most confused. What is to our purpose is the version of the
story in which the duumvirs appear. We are told that they
were elected. But whatever were the preliminary steps it is

now pretty well agreed that there was only one real trial (iudi-
cium) and that this was before the centuries Probably some
misunderstanding of an early narrative of the three hearings
has caused the confusion in Livy's narrative. Manlius was
put to death. See Livy VI 20 with Weissenborn’s notes, and
Zumpt Ι 2 pp 379-86, Lange Rom Alt 11 516.

(4) A notable case is that of P Claudius Pulcher who
with heedless levity disregarded the auspices and gave battle
to the Carthaginian fleet off Drepana, in which action he
was defeated with terrible loss. He was brought to trial (248‘

BC) for perduellu, and must have been condemned but for a
storm which stopped proceedings at the fourth hearing. The
renewal of this accusation was barred by the intervention of
tribunes. So he was brought before the tribes and fined 1000
asses for every ship lost. See Schol Bob quoted above, Cic
de nat deor 11 ἓ 7, Livy epit XIX, Suet Tib 2, Valer Max vm
1 absol §4, Zumpt 1 2 pp 201, 340, Lange 11 518.

(5) Very interesting is the attempt made to bring M Pos-
tumius Pyrgensis the contractor (publicanus) to trial on a ¹
charge of perduellio for the violence used to prevent condem·
nation for peculatus. But he forsook his sureties and bolted.
So the Tribes dealt with hirn as sels-condemned in his absence.
See Livy xxv 3,4, Zumpt Ι 2 pp 273, 313, 340-1, Lange ΙΙ 518.

(6) The case of Cn Fulvius in 211 BC is also important.
He had when praetor been in command of an army. This
he lost in a battle, where he himself shewed great cowardice.
A tribune brought him to trial, intending to get him fined by
the tribes. Two hearings passed on this understanding3 at
