MORE'S UTOPIA. With Notes by the Rev. J. RAWSoN

Lvunv, D.D. 3s. 6a'.

'⁴ lt was originally written in Latin and does not find a place on ordinary bookshelves. A very
great boon has therefore been conferred on the general English reader by the managers of the
Pitr Press Sen'es, in the issue of a convenient little volume of More's Utopria not in the original
Latin, but in the quaint English Translatr'on thereos made Raphe Robynron, which adds a
linguistic interest to the intrinsic merit of the work. . . . All t is has been edited in a most com·
plete and scholarly fashiou by Dr J. R. Lumby, the Norrisian Professor of Divinity‚ whose name
alone is a sufficient warrant for its accuracy. lt rs a real addition to the modern stock of classica!
English literature.”-Guardr'an.
