Ι We have now to consider the courts before which cases of

perduellio were brought, and the procedure employed. The
earliest case recorded-that oi Horatius—is said to have been
tried by' duumviri. We hear of such in one account oi the
condemnation oi Manlius, and we know that Rabirius was
brought before such a commission. The following points in
connexion with them deserve mention.

(a) They were probably an extraordinary² commission,
not a standing court oi justice. Indeed it is inconceivable
that they could have been the latter in the time of the kings.

Ι (b) We do not know that the king was obliged to appoint
them. I am inclined to think with Lange² that he was not;
but that, is he for any reason shrank irom exercising in any
case the plenary jurisdiction which he had in virtue oi his
imperium, he could and did appoint such commissioners, [τοττι

whose sentence there was an appeal to the people in their ⁸

curies, while srom that ol the king himself there was none.

(c) What was the form which the ¹appointment denoted .
by the word ‘facio’ took, is not certain. It may have been
that os direct nomination by the king. But it is perhaps
· more probable⁸ that the king announced his intention os

laying the case before commissioners, who were then by his ,

permission chosen by the curies. This would agree with the
story that Manlius was condemned through (per=thr0ugh
the intervention or agency os) duumvirs duly elected (creatu)
to conduct the enquiry; and also with Cicero's objection (ᾗ 12)
to the nomination ol the two who tried Rabirius as legally
null.

’ (d) Itis not certain⁴ why they were two in number.
