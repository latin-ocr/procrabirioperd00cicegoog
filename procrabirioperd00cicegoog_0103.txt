form of the sentence 3 and it is manifest that this was the
only penalty capable of being applied in all cases.

The penalty was outlawry, the consequences varying with
the severity of the sentence and the circumstances of the case.
The ancient form employed was a declaration that the outlaw
was prohibited from lire water and shelter. And in early
times when the bonds of state union were stronger, the denial
of these common elementary wants would probably mean
utter destruction to the victim of such a ban. But as the old
sentiments relaxed it became necessary, if the outlaw was to
be deprived of life or residence on Roman ground, to intro-
duce special penalties for the secondary offenders those who
did not help in giving effect to the sentence of the state.

The three principal degrees of this punishment may be
distinguished as follows.

i. The man was outlawed in the usual form, but no
limits were named within which alone the outlawry should
hold good. Thus it extended over the known world so far as
Roman law or influence could reach. Sometimes a reward
was offered to· any that should betray the outlaw or put him
to death. One very extreme sentence¹⁰ rendered all that
gave succour to the outlaw liable to the same penalty them·
selves. This was a rare and exceptionally severe form of the

penalty, and was applied only¹¹ in such cases as the proscrip-
tions of Sulla and the Triumvirs and against the murderers
of Caesar by the Pedian law.

ii. The man was outlawed in the usual form, but a limit
of so many miles from Rome was named, outside which he
was free from the ban. No reward was offered for his
betrayal or murder; but minor penalties were provided for
succouring him. This was the common form¹² of outlawry
