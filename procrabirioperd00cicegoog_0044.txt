the accused. Hereupon Rabirius appealed to the people.
That this means the people in their centuries¹³ is clear, for
since the Valerian laws that assembly had held the appellate
jurisdiction once exercised by the curies. But whether it was
necessary after the duumviral sentence to go through the
whole process of the four hearings, as in one os the ‘extra-
ordinary' tribunician trials, is so far as I know a question
which there are no means os answering. Anyhow the
assembly of the centuries met, and voting seems-to have
begun3 for we are told that the rejection of the appeal was
imminent when the praetor Metellus Celer ran and pulled
down the red flag, after which¹⁴ the proceedings necessarily ¹
cameto an end.

(f) Thus lar we have met with no difficulty of im-
portance. Here we arebrought face to face with the problem
on which so many scholars have of late exercised their wits.
Formerly it was assumed without hesitation that the surviving
speech of Cicero was delivered before the centuriate assembly
on the occasion of the appeal. Since Niebuhr¹⁵ this has been “

a disputed question, and the balance os expert opinion seems
to incline in favour of the other view-that it was delivered
at some stage of a fine-process, which was brought on aster
the capital process had miscarried. In this viewI had better
at once say that Ι concur. 1 proceed to consider the evidence
on which my conclusion is based; first the external, then the
internal.

(i) External.

1. Dion says that the hauling down ol the flag
saved Rabirius: Labienus might have brought him to
‘trial again, but he did not do so. Here 1 believe him
to speak of a renewal os the charge os perduelli03 which
