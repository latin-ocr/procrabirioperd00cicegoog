possible that, as aformal penalty of outlawry (aqua et igni inlerdt'cere)
probably belongs to a late age of Republican legislation, the Porcian law
may have employed this form, which soon, perhaps had already, assumed
much the same effective meaning. But if it did, then lange's earlier
dates will suit it far better than Zumpt's own And we must be careful
not to employ against it Zumpt’s favourite argument, that if it had
been so Cicero must surely have made some allusion to it in his speech

for Rabirius]

I can only say in general that Ι wish Ι could do more
towards removing the obscurity that surrounds this interesting
subject. In the state of the evidence I cando no more than
express a qualified approval⁸⁶ of the efforts of Lange. Zumpt
seems to aim at more precision than is really attainable‚ and
in the attempt to prove negatives he is misapplying an inde-
pendent and honest judgment

The references to lex Porcia in the speech for Rabirius
(§§ 8, 12, 13) are of so general a nature that they cannot in
my opinion be fairly applied to any one of the three laws, but
must be taken as a loose reference to the Porcian legislation
as a whole. Even were they not such, their authority would
not serve to establish anything3 for there is nothing that
Cicero would not say to suit the needs of his case.

To begin again with quotations, I select the following.

(1) Plutarch C Gracchus 4 δύο νόμους εἰσέφερε, τὸν με’ν...
............ τὸν δέ, εἴ τις ἄρχων ἄκριτον ἐκκεκηρύχοι πολίτην, κατ’
αὐτοῦ δίδοντο κρίσιν τῷ δήμῳ. τούτων τῶν νόμων ἄντικρυς ὁ
μὲν ......... τῷ δ’ ἐνείχετο Ποπίλλιον οὗτοςι «γὰρ στρατηγῶν
τους τοῦ Τιβερίου φίλους ἐξεκήρυξε. καὶ Ποπιλλιος μὲν οὐχ
ὑποστὰς τὴν κρίσιν ἔφυγεν ἐξ Ἰταλίας.

³⁶ Lange’s theory is accepted by Mr ¹ See Cic Laelius ξ 37, Velleius 11 7
Wordsworth in his ‘Fragments and §a

Specimens‘ p 624.
