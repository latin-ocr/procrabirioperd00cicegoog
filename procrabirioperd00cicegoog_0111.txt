APPENDIX

(1) Porcius Laeca was probably an adherent of the
nobility, or he would not have been made¹' one of the
tresviri epulones who were then (first time) appointed,
doubtless under aristocratic influence. Now the benefit
of the new law tested, as will be seen, almost entirely
with the travelling capitalists It is quite inconsistent
with what we know¹⁸ of the character and career of

1 Cato that he should have proposed a measure to weaken

the control of these gentry by the provincial govemors.

The law is therefore more probably to be regarded as a

crafty move of his opponente They outbid¹⁹ him in

· the quest of popularity by carrying further the principle

which he had made his own and consequently could

not oppose. [And the selection of a Porcius as their

tool for this purpose would have about it an ironical
plausibility eminently Roman]

(2) So far as can be gathered bya not too timid
inference from a solitary fact, it appears that the prin-
cipal enactment of this law was the extension of the
privilege granted in that of Cato to all citizens living or
carrying on civilian pursuits in Italy beyond the mile
radius and in the provinces. At least we know that
such an extension did take place²⁰ in the case of the
provinces, and from this we may argue a fortiori to
Italy. Indeed the spread of empire and dispersion of
large numbers of citizens travelling on business about
so many countries had made the old mile limit an
absurdity. lts original intention had no doubt been
to reserve the full imperium to the general in the field.

(3) That we do not hear of a single case of a pro-
vincial governor being impeached²1 before the people
for a breach of this law, is easily accounted for. The
governors knew better than to vent their displeasure on
