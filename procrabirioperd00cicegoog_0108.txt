APPENDIX 101

Porcia lar he is in like manner including the three lagos of
members of the grus Porcia under a singular appellation.
In the next place we may observe that Livy lays stress on
the lack of penal sanctio in the Valerian legislation, and seems
to mean that this defect was remedied by the Porcian;
wherein he and Cicer0, whose words are more definite, per·
fectly agree. Whether they are right in affirming so direct a
connexion between the Porcian laws⁶ and those concerned
with the right of appeal is not certain. It should also be
noted that the protection 'of the backs of citizens was ac-
cording to Livy the object of the Porcian legislation and of
that alone.

Accepting the statement that there were three Porcian
laws and that they were carried by three different members
of that house, we are unfortunately unable to determine with
certainty when and by what persons they were severally
carried A fair degree of probability is alone attainable.
Lange⁷ observes that we only know of three magistrates of
the grus Porcia in the period⁸ to which these laws must
belong; and to these he proceeds to assign the three laws‚
the enactments of which have to be gathered from a very
meagre body of evidence.
