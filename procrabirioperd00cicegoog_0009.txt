The study of this speech and of the interesting questions

connected therewith will be especially uselul to students Ἴ

concerned with the history ol the iudicia publica, to under-
’ stand which some knowledge of the earlier iudicia populi
is required. And addressing myself as Ι do to elder
students I have throughout assumed that nobody will read
the book who has not a lair acquaintance with the outlines

of Roman history and constitutional antiquities. Ι have .

therefore made free use ol technical language, which is
necessary is one is to discuss intricate and obscure questions
within a reasonable compass.

The merits of the speech are plain to any that will
consider the position of affairs at the time of its delivery.
Party hatred, fostered by desperate men, was ready to break
out into violence at any moment; and the impeachment
and defence of Rabirius were ominous of the coming storm.
Ι have in my notes on the speech striven to call attention
to the clever audacity of the speaker, of which there are
many notable instances

In the endeavour t0 make my meaning clearer Ι have
used an elaborate system of grouping‚ by which Ι hope the
questions treated in the Introduction and appendices may
be kept from mutually obscuring and interfering with one
another. Ι have made a practice of giving either by way
ol reference or in full quotation the authorities for 'the
statements upon which my conclusions are based. This is a
very tedious business; and many a time have I wished that
I could afford to say with Madvig ‘iiberhaupt habe ich alles
weggelassen, was nur zum Prunk der Gelehrsamkeit gehort'.
Butos course I could not do this, and can only hope that
I have not overloaded the book with ¹irrelevant matter,

To Mr J S Reid ol Gonville and Caius College Ι owe
and hereby render my heartiest thanks. He read the whole
book through in proof and sent me most valuable notes
