Saturninus, having through the violent assault ol the quaestor
Q Servilius Caepio been prevented from carrying his lex Ι

agrario, shortly after in the same year (103 Bc) brought
lorward his lex de oraiestate and apparently carried it. It was

drawn up in the most general termS, imposing certain penal-
ties on those who should in any way lessen the majesty
(minuere maiestatem) ol the Roman people. It was made to
apply (like the laws on reperandae) to magistrates and sena-
tors only. It was probably rneant to check the mutual oppo-
sition of magistrates, and possibly in the lirst instance to
supply a means ol punishing Caepio But it certainly gave
no definition os maiestas: hence all was lest to rest on inter-
pretation, in which the Roman pleaders found a congenial
occupation for their talents. The court⁴' to try cases of
minuto maiestas was a quaestio perpetua. The penalty was the
capital one os aquae et egoz's interdictio. This law afforded
powerful protection to the tribunes in whose person the
“ oear'estas of the Roman people was especially centred. It
was followed by the lex Varia os the tribune Q Varius in
90 BC, which extended the operation of the above to the
movers and supporters os the Social war. Next, apparently
in 81 BC, came the much wider and more detailed lex cornelio
ol Sulla, by thch the lex Appuleia was repealed. Its opera-
tion extended to the provinces, but it like the earlier laws
applied to magistrates and senators only. A definition os
the crime was given, bringing under it many and various

offences—lor instance, any lessening os the state’s resources
property or power; opposition to any magistrate, and thereby
to the senate⁴⁸, to which body Sulla sought to secure the
control os all officers ol state3 exceeding official powers;
neglect of duty. It will be seen at once that this law tended
to limit the competence ol individual magistrates and also
