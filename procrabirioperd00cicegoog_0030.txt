as to the accuser's power of choosing in what court he would
press for the final decision, and consequently what penalty he
would propose to inflict. His view is this. Two periods in
the history of the procedure may be traced. In the earlier
we find the connexion between the three preliminary hearings
and the fourth or final one still distant and loose: in the later
they are brought into close connexion. In the earlier period
the tribune could after the three hearings decide for himself
whether he would aim at procuring a capital sentence from ’
the centuries or content himself with moving for the infliction
of a fine (mztltae irrogatio) in the assembly of the tribes. if
he chose the former, he must apply to the consul or praetor
urbanus to name some dz‘es ιονηὶῑὶαἰιζς85 for the purpose; if the
latter, he could (unless his own colleagues interfered) make all
the necessary arrangements himself In the later period he
was obliged³⁶ to choose from the outset the course he meant
to pursue. The date of this change is uncertain; its effect,
and perhaps the object of its promoters‚ was to make capital
trials more difficult and so more rare.

(nn) I have referred above to the practice of the tribunes
in the period before the Twelve Tables, of bringing offenders
before the assembly of tribea, and pointed out that in the case
of patrician offenders it was perhaps necessary to procure the
consent of the senate. But it seems that this attempt to
secure for the tribes a capital jurisdiction⁸⁷ coordinate with
that of the centuries was foiled by the legislation of the
decemvirs There remained the power of inflicting fines, and
this milder form of penalty sufficed³⁸ for many—perhaps
