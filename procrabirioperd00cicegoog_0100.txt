Appsuorx 93

classification os crimes the terminology was enlarged before a
statutory separation took place.

(6) It now remains to apply the above to the explanation
of pro Rabirio ᾗ 8. Ι cannot agree with Rein that the burn·
ing ol the tabularium was the act characterized by the accuser
as peculatus. lt seems far more likely²⁴ that Curtius had been
charged with (a) some more direct actos peculatus (b) an in-
cendiary act sor the purpose of suppressing the evidence²⁵ of
the former. That this latter act might from one point of view
have been regarded as peculatus, l do not deny: but Ι think
the words of Cicero point more naturally to the conclusion l
have ventured to draw. Whether the juxtaposition of the
reference to a sacrilegious act (ξ 7) is in any way significant, l
cannot say. The information is too scanty to warrant even a
conjecture.

however say that my debt to him is very great]

0· OF THE AQUAE ET IGNIS INTERDICTIO.

The most interesting passages bearing upon this subject
are thesollowing ἵ

condemnati nau prius leam civitatem amittebant quam eraut iu
eam recepti qua vertendi, bacest mutandi, sali causa uerreraut; id
autem ut esset setimdianum ademptione ciuitatis sed tecti et
aquae et iguis interdictione adigebantur.

(2) Cicero, pro Caecina§ 100 num'quad adeusilium attinet,
perspicue intelligi petest quale sit. exsilium euim rrau supplicium
cst, scd perfugium partusque supplici. nam qui volunt aliquam
paenam subterfugere aut calamitatem, eu salum uertunt, bac est,
sedem ac lacum mutant. itaque nulla iu lege uestra reperietur,
