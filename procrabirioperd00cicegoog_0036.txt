INTRODUCTION 25

influenced by other considerations than justice. To conclude,
by the lee Iulia de maiestate of Bc 46 it is probable that the
older offence was still more completely absorbed in maiestas:
and whether the term perduellio still found even in the Digest
of Justinian be anything more than (as Rein⁶¹ thinks) an
untechnical expression for the higher degree of maiestas it is
beyond my province to enquire.

(1) The famous case of Horatius, for a full discussion of
which see Prof E C Clark's Early Roman Law ἓξ 11-17.
As to the treatment of a case of parricidium as one osperduel·
lie, it should be noted that (a) Horatius was acquitted of
the former by his father, (b) Horatius had, by murdering his
sister, assumed the right of judgment‚ which did not belong to
him. See in illu'stration Wharton’s Law Lexicon under ‘Petit
Treason’.

(2) The agrarian law of Sp Cassius (consul 486 BC) so
stirred patrician hatred against him that in 485 he was brought

to trial. The charge was that he sought to make himself ·

king, and his intended liberality to the Latins and Hernicans
made him unpopular with the plebs. The form of the trial
was probably that of an indictment for perduellio preferred
against him by the quaestors¹ before the comitia centuriata.-
The elaborate procedure which we find later was most likely
not developed at this early date. No duumvirs are men-
· tioned, but there may have been such—the quaestors may
have acted in that capacity. From the words cedente popule
in Cic de re publ ΙΙ § 60 Zumpt infers that it was a case of
appeal to the people from the sentence of the quaestors. The
accused was probably not left at large, for we find that on
condemnation he was put to death. See Zumpt's Criminal-
