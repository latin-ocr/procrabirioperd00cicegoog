the third, so clearly did his misconduct and cowardice appear,
the contio called lor a capital prosecution, When the tribune
declared his intention of turning the fine-process into a capital
one, the accused demurred, but the other tribunes declared
the proceeding legal. The accuser then got a day fixed sor
comitia centuriata. Fulvius found all his hopes vain, and went
into voluntary exile, which was then approved and confirmed
by the tribes See Livy XXVI 3, Zumpt Ι 2 pp 272, 313, 341,
Lange II 518.

(7) The case of Q Pleminius (204 Bc) should be read in
Livy XXIX 8, 9, 16-22. The commission sent to enquire into
his impieties and cruelties at Locri was accompanied by two ’
tribunes: and it was probably these two who accused Plemi-
nius and his abettors when brought to Rome, on a charge
most likely oi perduellio. It seems that the comitia for the

ground oi their invasion ol the rights of tribunes The real
motives were personal pique and discontent with their finan-
cial measures Claudius came very near condemnation: on
his acquittal, the tribune let Gracchus go. See Livy XLIII 16,
Zumpt I 2 pp 203, 343-4, Lange ΙΙ 523.

(9) The accusation to avoid which P Popillius Laenas
went into exile was probably one osperduellio. See appendix
F and Zumpt Ι 2 pp 346-7.

(10) So doubtless was that of LdOpimius wh0, acting on
the sctrrru ultimum, suppressed the movements os C Gracchus¹
with violence. With great difficulty he was got off. See
Zumpt Ι 2 pp 347-8, Lange ΙΙ 524.

(11) Os C Popillius Laenas we are expressly told by
Cicero that he was tried for perduellio, though in rhet ad
Herennium 1 ἓ 25 it is called maiestas. It took place in 107
or 106 BC. His offence was misconduct in the field and the
