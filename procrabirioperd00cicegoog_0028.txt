· (le) The hindrances²'¹ just referred to were in general as
follows:
(1) The intercessio ol a tribune. This might os
course be employed to stop proceedings at any stage.
But it was not customary to employ it at the pre-
liminary hearingS. This means of protection for the
accused was probably not very osten employed, and
was anyhow too capricious in its action to be of any
¹ certain use in furtherance of justice.
(2) An obstructive policyon the part of the accused
and his supporters. This would for the most part take
, the sorm of an effort to ‘talk out the motion’ (dicendo
diem eximere or consumere etc). Itis to be remembered
that there was a long day’s work to be got through in
any case. The assembly of the centuries for voting ,
was preceded hythe fourth contio, and was even by
itself a most clumsy apparatus at all times.
(3) Unlavourable auspices, obnuntiatio, and the
occurrence ol any phenomena regarded as ominous It
- is unnecessary to dwell at any length on this familiar
subject. ι
(4) The removal of the red flag, whether as a bona
fide warning of an enemy's approach or as' a dodge in
the interest of the accused. See appendix I.
(5) The absence of the accused on some good
· ground (eg excusatio morbo). It seems that it rested
with the accusing tribune²⁸ to decide whether an excuse
was valid or not, his decision not being final unless
approved by the consent or silence of his colleagues.

So many chances had even the guiltiest criminal os escap-
ing punishment without acquittal.
