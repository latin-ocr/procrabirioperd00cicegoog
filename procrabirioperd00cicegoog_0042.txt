senate would be lowered and weakened by the loss of 'the
weapon on which it had become accustomed to rely‚ and
therebya great sear taken off ‘popular' tribunes, whose de·
signs the senate had been able to checkmate by the destruction
of the leader. ,

(c) It will be seen that the acts for commission of or
participation in which somebody was to be brought to trial
were either lawful and unpunishable or criminal in the highest
degree and rendering their perpetrator liable to the uttermost
penalties of the law. The real question was the constitutional
one as to the quality of the acts. And as from the point of
view of the poculares the slaughter of a tribune was a crime
exceptionally heinous it follows that the accusation could
only be brought under one of two hema—maiestas or per-
duellio. But maiestas was tried in one of the permanent jury
courts, the members of which,‹being taken from the wealthier
classes and representing⁶ the ‘party of order’‚ were sure to
acquit a man accused on that charge. There remained per-
duellio, in which two forms of procedure were possible—the
direct tribunician‚ by the four hearings, and the ancient one
by duumvirs, subject to the right of appeal. Of these the
latter was chosen, probably with the view of more effectually
frightening the senatorial party by means of the long-disused
barbarous penalty named in the ancient law.

(d) The victim selected was old and insignificant‚ but in
all probability one who had in his time done⁷ other deeds of
violence than that now laid to his charge, and so not without
enemies. He had however hitherto escaped the hand of the
law. An accuser was found in the tribune T Atius Labienus,

ready to avenge the death of an uncle who had taken part “

with Saturninus and lost his life on that occasion. Labienus
then was to accuse Rabirius of perduellio before duumvirs,
(e) Such was the resolution of the democratic leaders.
