D. Or Tun aar raam.

The lex Fabia de plagzbriis¹ was most likely passed in the
last century of the Republic, or a little earlier; and it con-
tinued to be much used and commented on in the imperial
times. It dealt with² the offence of kidnapping concealing
detaining buying selling etc (a) a Roman citizen freeborn or
freed (b) a free Latin (c) the slave of another man-the
same being done with knowledge and dolo malo. The trials
under this law were so far as we can gather always iudicia
publica. The penalty following on conviction was atone
time a money fine, but it was afterwards made more severe
and varied, according to the rank and quality of the offender,
from a fine with banishment for life to crucifixion or slavery
in the mines. The money fine was naturally accompanied by
infamia.

How the offence had been dealt with before the lex Fabia
is not certain: possibly (as Rein suggests) variously according
to circumstances, either by a iudicium populi or by the in-
terdict de homine libero exhibendo or by actio furti or actio
serui corrupti.

The mere fact of there being need of such a law speaks
volumes as to the horrible condition of Italy, both social
and economic, in the age after the Punic wars,

recht pp 386—9, Lange's Romische Alterthiimer ΙΙ pp 617-8,
