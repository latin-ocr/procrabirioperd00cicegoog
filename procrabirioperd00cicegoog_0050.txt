Labienus is treated as accuser. Now so far as we know
the procedure by duumvirs from the only case recorded

· -that os Horatius-it seems that the appeal from their
decision introduced a direct contest⁸⁴ between them and
the accused. In fact they are the accusers Now, how·
ever unwilling Cicero may have been to make any re-
ference to Caesar, he can hardly have avoided doing so
in the speech before the centuries. This he would very
likely tone down in a subsequent edition, but Ι do not
think that he would omit⁸⁶ it altogether. The auctor
lzuz'us iudici of ξ 33 might be Caesar, but is more
probably Labienus who by a rogatio had originally set
on foot the trial.

Such is the evidence, scattered meagre and inconclusive‚
on whicha conclusion has to be based. Ihave endeavoured

to state it fairly: and Ι think that the delicate balance of
probability inclines to the side Ι have taken. Ι hold that the
speech edited and preserved by Cicero was one in which he
selt that he had done justice to his powers, his effort in a
cause won. Whether³⁶ Labienus withdrew from the trial alter
this speech, or whether a vote was taken and Rabirius saved,
Ι cannot say. But that he was saved Ι cannot doubt. l
have now only to acknowledge with gratitude my debt to
Professor Huschke, to whom I owe so much of the help ne-
cessary in treating of this very difficult subject.
