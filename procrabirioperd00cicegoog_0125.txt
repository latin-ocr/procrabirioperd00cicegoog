caprice prejudice and party or personal hatred. It was not
an enduring⁶ condition, but had to be renewed each time by
the new censors But theman so degraded on one occasion
might be reinstated by the next censors in his full privileges;
or the two censors might disagree, and what one had done his
colleague would readily und0. There were various degrees⁶
os this degradation« Probably the ius hortonam was in any
case lost. But in other respects it seems that the censors in-
flicted more or less disgrace (as senatu oravere, equum vendere
iubere, tribu oravere, aerarium facere) according to their con·
ception oi deserts and the rank of the offender. They need
not act in recognition of existing infamia, or of a judicial
decision os any kind ;;Ι public rumour was enough. The igno-
minia was not strictly speakingl a penalty, nor the censor’s
decision a z'udicz'um.. It should be added that the aerarius
lost ius suffragi altogether, while the man tribu motus in the
milder sense⁸ (transferred from a· rural to a city tribe) gota
worse vote. The aerarius remained liable⁰ to army service,

though not in the legion, and also was exposed to arbitrary
taxation.

It seems then that the man infamis gives the name to his
condition os infamia, while on the other hand the imposed
condition ol zgrtominia makes a man agnominemur.
