22 INTRODUCTION

the latter case Livy makes it :capital offence. These cases
it is true are os a military⁴³ nature: but that ol the two
censors is not, nor can it be explained as perduellio on any
other assumption than that given above. Again the use of
iudicare as opposed to inultam irrogare seems to group the
capital trials together and to correspond to the expression in
which the word perduellio occurs. Ι wish Ι felt more satisfied
as to the completeness of the proos os this; as it io, I can only
say that with one limitation—applying it only to the cases of
a political nature⁴⁴ dealt with by the ‘extraordinary' process
ol the tribunes, which Ι believe Zumpt to mean—I think it
probable. For the present I prefer to say with Lange⁴⁵ that
it is but natural we should hear only of politically important
cases, and that cases of perduellio are especially of this nature,
being generally accusations of magistrates, .What with the
fine-processes belore the tribes and occasional special com-
missionS, the capital processes before the centuries probably
became exclusively political and very rare. Indeed in all the
filth century ol the city (353-253 BC) we do not find a
single case os the kind,—no doubt because the tribunes were
on good terms with the nobility. Ἴ

and the early legislation relating theret0. It had become
more and more an established custom to apply the fine·
process belore the tribes to cases that might have been treated
as perduellio. Sooner or later some one was sure to find out
a simpler way of dealing with all or some os these cases. As
the social and political fabric os the Republic gave way, the
need became more pressing. At last the tribune L Appuleius
