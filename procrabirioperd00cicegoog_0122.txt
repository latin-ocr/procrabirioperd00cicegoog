· The following points also deserve attention, though· the .
evidence does not warrant the drawing ο1 certain conclusions.

(6) It is probable that their orde was—at all events aiter
the passing ο1 the leu Aurelt‘u—based' like that oi equites on a
definite census footing. For not only would this be very natu·
ral in itsels and in accordance with Roman precedent, but we
know that when Augustus added a fourth decuria⁸ he took its
members from a class defined by census. It is thus almost
certain that the same principle was acted upon throughout.

(7) It is probable that their name was inherited from the
tribuni aerarii ol whom we have mention’ as existing in
ancient times. These seem to have been persons entrusted
with the duty of receiving the tributum (which was raised tri-
butim) and paying the money to the soldiers as stipendium.
In the later days of the Republic the raising of tributum
ceased and the stipendium was paid through the quaestors. It
is therefore not to be wondcred at that we find no mention of
tribuni aerarii again until the time ol Cicero. They may
have been in some sense a survival os the agents employed in
ancient times. But how they came to outlive the loss of their
functione how they became an orde at all, whether they were
in any way connected with the curatores tribuum mentioned
by Varro—these questions, though ‚interesting in themselves,
admit ο1 no definite answer in the present state of the evi-
dence; indeed they are mere matters os baseless speculation.

(8) The opinion of Mommsen, that they were men oseques-
trian census who had served the office ο1 tributuus aerarius, is
open to several objections. Passing over the point that this
