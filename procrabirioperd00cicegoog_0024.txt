iudicio together with the fourth or final hearing. 1 proceed
to consider the proceedings in one of these public criminal
trials, without attempting to decide whether Zumpt’s dis-

tinction between ‘ordinary' and ‘extraordinary' trials be
valid or not: for Ι amconvinced that it is not of much prac-

(d) First, the supposed offender was ordered to appear
(adesse iussus) before the tribune, who declared his intention
of bringing him to trial and fixed a day for the first hearing

of the case to take place (diei dicto). This act¹¹ made the
man technically reus. If the tribune chose, he might name
the current day and proceed at once with the first hearing.
This was as follows The tribune called the people together
toan informal meeting (contio) in some public place, generally
the forum. He presided himself: and the reus or privatus

was now publicly summoned by the voice of the herald to ι

appear before the people (citatus) and called upon to make
his defence (causam dicere iussus). Speeches were made on
both sides and witnesses produced (testes dare or proferre).
Perhaps¹² the penalty was named by the accuser. When the
tribune saw fit, he declared the hearing adjourned¹⁸ to another
day¹ (diem proderit) which he named. He then bound over
the accused to appear at the time named, usually by finding
sureties (vades dare)¹⁴ for his appearance: but if the case was
a very serious one he imprisoned him during the interval
rather than leave him at large on any terms. When the day
for the second hearing arrived, proceedings began again with
the citatio and continued till the tribune as before announced
the prodictio diei. In like manner¹ the third hearing was con·
ducted, but the position of affairs at its close was essentially
different It was no longer²⁶ in the power of the tribune to
