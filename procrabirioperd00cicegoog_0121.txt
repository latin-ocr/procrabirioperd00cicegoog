In the year 70 Bc the praetor LAurelius Cotta carried¹
a law for the reform of the criminal courts By this he de-
prived the senators of that exclusive right of sitting on juries
which had been restored to thern by Sulla. But he did not
simply divide this power equally between the senators and
equites: he ordained that each jury should consist ol three
'panels (decttrzue)², one os senators one of equites one os tribuni
aerarii. Of these last we can only be said to know the follow·
ing facts.

(1) They were recognized as a clearly marked classium)
os citizens. The way in which they are spoken οἷ’ proves
this.

, (2) They wereanumerous class, or they would not have
been able to supply a sufficient number of competent jurors.

(3) They were closely connected with the equites; for not
only are they generally mentioned as acting in full sympathy
with them, but in passages⁴ where nothing turns on the dis·
tinct mention of the third decuria we find the term equites
used to include both.

(4) They were (as we should expect) [not confined to
Rome, but were some of them resident⁶ in municipia.

(5) Their judicial function was taken from them⁶ by
Julius Caesar.
