had been supported and the senators who had assisted in the
passing oi a sctum sor the appointment ol any such extra-
ordinary judicial commission. He urges that the measures
employed against the adherents ol Ti Gracchus would not
have been undertaken by the boldest of consuls on their own
sole responsibility: they must have acted on instructions from
the senate. Ι must admit the plausibility of this view. He
goes on to shew that the timidity os certain senators shewn in
absenting themselves from the debate on the Catilinarians
may be best accounted soron this supposition. The senate
was acting illegally¹⁵ as a court ol justice on that occasion.
The argument of Cicer0, that the men were hostes not cives,
was a mere evasion; for their true character had only been
prejudged by the sctum ultimum, the constitutional validity of
which had been receutly called in question inthe caseos
Rabirius, which wasa moral defeat for the senate. We can
well understand au unwillingness on the part os cautious mem-
bers to render themselves by participatiou in such proceedings
liable to the penalties of the Sempronian law. Allowing this
explanation to be plausible, I must add that the attempt os
Cicero to construe the presence of Caesar into an admission¹⁸

that the law did not apply in the case was no more than the
artlul hit of a elever debater. All that Caesar wanted¹⁷ was
to save the prisoners from the blind sury of the moment. His
own risk under the Sempronian law would be practically
nothing; and it was no time to be pointing out the risk run
by others when there was nothing to be gained by it in
debate.

(4) Whether the law was in any degree retrospective in
its effect, seems very doubtful. Plutarch clearly understood
it to have been 80, but his cursory notice cannot be held to
prove that the law under which the quaestio extraordinaria to
try Popillius was appointed was the same law as the above.
But that either a separate law or a special clause of this one
