” It seems that in early times the fines imposed by magis·
frates (multae o't'ctio) or named in laws were not allowed to
exceed the half ¹ of 'the offender’s property. But it is certain
that'in the fine-processes before the comitio tributa this limita·
tion was not⁹ observed. This may be explained by observing
that each inultae irrogatio was a separate legislative act³ and
‘that‘ the sovereign people could only be bound hythe expres-
sion‘of its own will:

The simple multae dz'ctio brought⁴ no infamia. The multa
according to Huschke⁶ is essentially a composition for some
wrong done. But the multae irrogatio isan attempt to get a
‘fine inflicted by the peoplefi and so to force the accused to
compound for an offence which might have been dealt with as
perduellio. There is therefore strong a priori likelihood that
condemnation in· such a fine-process would make a man
infamis. That a vote of the people in their centuries should
deprive a man of all that made life worth having, or even of
life itself, while a vote of the same given by tribes could inflict
a fine but involved no further consequenceS‚ isa position of
affairs hardly conceivable. Y'et it seems to have been so‘ (at
Ι least in theory) in the case⁸ of Menenius. But we are told
that he would not endure the disgrace put upon him, and died
of a broken heart. So too Livius Salinat0r⁹ would not bear
