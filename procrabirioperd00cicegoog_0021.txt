But by far the greater number of the trials for perduellio
with which we are acquainted occurred in the Republican
period, and the procedure was of a very different kind from the
above. At the risk of seeming tedious 1 venture to append a
sketch of this procedure, without some account of which it is
impossible to understand the case of Rabirius and indeed
many others also. The matter of this chapter (0) is mainly
taken from or written with reference to Zumpt’s Criminal-

recht, where the subject is dealt with more at length than in '

any of the other works Ι have been able to consult.

(a) It is well known that Roman jurisprudence from very
early times distinguished the two stages of a civil action (1)
the definition of the legal question involved, known as the
proceeding in titre, being conducted before the magistrate,
and (2) the decision of this question, known as the proceeding
in iudicia being conducted before the competent court,
whether held by the magistrate himself or by some iudex t0

whom he referred the matter. But it seems that this principle
of division was recognized in criminal¹ actions also and that
they also began with in ius vocatio: thus Horatius was we are
told raptus in ius ad regem. We shall presently see that the
procedure of the criminal trials before the people (z‘udicia
populi) falls into these divisions

(b) The accusers² must be magistrates: as a matter of

fact they were almost always the quaestores in the period
before the Twelve Tables3 after that date generally tribuni
plebis, now and then their subordinates the aediles. At the

sen 11 papo, Lange 1 385—9. The those that came under some definite
aediles seem to have been originally to statute. For the quaestors see note on
the tribunes much what the quaestors Introd D (α). Mommsen 11 pp 30²,
were to the consuls, see also Mommsen 600, thinks they were only competent
11 pp 466-7. Perhaps the aediles couid to deal with murder and other common
only accuse in fine-processes, Huschke non-political offences.
